<br/>

DataKind volunteers often need access to specific data or techniques in
a DataDive or other project. The goal of DataKindR is to make it easier
for volunteers to access these resources.

Please note that the author of this package has no official affiliation
with DataKind UK (despite having volunteered with them a number of
times).

<br/>

## Installation

You can install the development version of DataKindR from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("p0bs/DataKindR")
```

<br/>

## Access to resources

Whilst this list could grow, DataKindR currently provides:

- Postcode cleansing
- Mapping postcodes to other geographical metadata

For an example on how to use these functions, read the ‘Getting
geographic metadata from UK postcodes’ vignette.

If you can think of anything else, feel free to contribute to this
package. Thanks.
