DataKind volunteers often need access to specific data or techniques in
a DataDive or other project.

The goal of DataKindR is to make it easier for volunteers to access
these resources.

<br/>

## Installation

You can install the development version of DataKindR from GitHub with:

``` r

## Access to resources

Here are the types of data and technique that DataKindR will provide:

- Postcode cleansing
- API helper functions to access demographic data by postcode

If you can think of anything else, feel free to contribute to this
package. Thanks.
