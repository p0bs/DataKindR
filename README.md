DataKind volunteers often need access to specific data or techniques in
a DataDive or other project. The goal of DataKindR is to make it easier
for volunteers to access these resources.

## Installation

You can install the development version of DataKindR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("p0bs/DataKindR")
```

## Access to resources

Here are the types of data and technique that DataKindR will provide:

  - Constituency-level data in the UK
  - Country dedupe and join approaches
  - Summarising data

If you can think of anything else, feel free to contribute to this
package. Thanks.
