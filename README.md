DataKind volunteers often need access to specific data or techniques in
a DataDive or other project.

The goal of DataKindR is to make it easier for volunteers to access
these resources.

## Installation

You can install the development version of DataKindR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("p0bs/DataKindR")
```

## Access to resources

Here are the types of data and technique that DataKindR will provide:

  - Constituency-level data in the UK (the `parlitools` package) but
    adding a join for short postcodes and demographic data
  - Country de-duplication and joining approaches (the `countrycode`
    package)
  - Summarising data (the `skimr` package)

If you can think of anything else, feel free to contribute to this
package. Thanks.
